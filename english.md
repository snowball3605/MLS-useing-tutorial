        <b>Hello everyone, 
		Welcome to use the MLS bot belonging to NRTS, first of all, before you use the robot, you must use the command /anset [channel] to set the channel you 			want to receive important information and update announcements from the robot, we very strongly recommend using. then, in GitHub, I have created a 			tutorial on how to use the robot.If unfortunately you did not watch the teaching and used it improperly and caused an error, we will not make any 			compensation. It should be noted that we will suspend the robot from time to time every day for maintenance, and we will post an announcement on the 			channel you set ten minutes before the maintenance. We will not compensate you for any loss during the period. But if you don't use the command to set up 		  your channel, we will not pay any compensation 

Thank you for using :>
